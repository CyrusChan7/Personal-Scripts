### A script to automatically invite specified people to your squad party in Guild Wars 2, an MMORPG developed by ArenaNet.

<br/>  

  
#### **Disclaimer:** Only invite people that explicitly gave you permission to invite them. Abuse or malicious use of this script may lead to the termination of your Guild Wars 2 account.
I am NOT responsible for what you do with this script.


#### **Usage:**  
1. Open the `names.txt` file.
2. Replace the existing names with the names of the people that you wish to invite.
3. Run `main.py` as an administrator.

    **Note:** The format must remain the same, one name per line.


#### **Programs required** (make sure to run as administrator as it involves interacting with another program):
- Python 3
- Visual Studio Code (Optional)
- Guild Wars 2


#### **Python library dependencies:**
- pyautogui
- pydirectinput


#### **TODO:**
- Add more error handling
- Add more comments and documentation (Sphinx)
- Add random/ non-random invite toggle
