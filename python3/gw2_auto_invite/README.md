### A script to automatically invite specified people to your squad party in Guild Wars 2, an MMORPG developed by ArenaNet.

<br/>  

  
#### **Disclaimer:** Only invite people that explicitly gave you permission to invite them. Abuse or malicious use of this script may lead to the termination of your Guild Wars 2 account.
I am NOT responsible for what you do with this script.


#### **Usage:**  
1. Open the `names.txt` file.
2. Replace the existing names with the names of the people that you wish to invite. (**Note:** The format must remain the same, one name per line.)
3. Save `names.txt` and close the file.
4. Run `main.py` as an administrator.



#### **Programs required:**
- Python 3
- Visual Studio Code (Optional)
- Guild Wars 2


#### **Python library dependencies:**
- pyautogui 0.9.52
- pydirectinput 1.0.4
- tqdm 4.59.0
  
You may choose to install the libraries all at the same time using the command `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`, or install them one by one manually.


#### **To-do:**
None currently, but I am always open to suggestions.
