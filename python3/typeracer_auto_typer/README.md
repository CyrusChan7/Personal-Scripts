#### **Disclaimer:** Only use this script when you are in a private lobby playing against friends for good fun. Do NOT use this script in public races as this is against TypeRacer's Terms of Service.
I am NOT responsible for what you do with this script.


#### **Usage:**
1. Click Allow Copy extension (this allows you to copy text on websites that have blocked this functionality).
2. Copy the TypeRacer phrase during the preparation phrase.
3. Click Allow Copy extension again to disable the copy functionality.
4. Open the `phrase.txt` file.
5. Paste the copied text.
6. Save and close `phrase.txt`.
7. Run `main.py` as an administrator.
8. Click the text box in TypeRacer and wait 5 seconds.



#### **Programs required** (make sure to run as administrator as it involves interacting with another program):
- Python 3
- Visual Studio Code (Optional)
- A web browser that supports the Allow Copy extension


#### **Python library dependencies:**
- pyautogui


#### **TODO:**
- Add documentation (Sphinx)
- Add `"` as a supported character to be typed
