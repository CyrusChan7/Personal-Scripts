### A script to automatically type ~120-140 words per minute for you in TypeRacer.

<br/>  

  
#### **Disclaimer:** Only use this script when you are in a private lobby playing against friends for good fun. Do NOT use this script in public races as this is against TypeRacer's Terms of Service.
I am NOT responsible for what you do with this script.


#### **Usage:**
1. Click the Simple Allow Copy extension icon to enable.
2. Copy the TypeRacer phrase during the preparation phrase.
3. Click the Simple Allow Copy extension icon again to disable.
4. Open the `phrase.txt` file.
5. Paste the copied text.
6. Save and close `phrase.txt`.
7. Run `main.py` as an administrator.
8. Click the text box in TypeRacer and wait 5 seconds.



#### **Programs required** (make sure to run as administrator as it involves interacting with another program):
- Python 3
- Visual Studio Code (Optional)
- A web browser that supports the [Simple Allow Copy](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/simple-allow-copy/aefehdhdciieocakfobpaaolhipkcpgc) browser extension  
  **Note:** This is required as TypeRacer blocks the copy & paste functionality on their website. This extension bypasses said restriction.


#### **Python library dependencies:**
- pyautogui 0.9.52  

To easily install, use the command `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.


#### **To-do:**
None currently, but I'm always open to suggestions.
